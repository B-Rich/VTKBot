Run 'python tests.py' to run the VTKBot tests.
To see how well the coverage of the source files is,
run the tests with python-coverage: 'python-coverage  -x tests.py'
Afterwards, you can check the coverage of a file with:
'python-coverage -r FILENAME'

Major points for writing tests:
    - Try to get coverage as high as possible (for example, the Quote and Ping plugin, as well as the VTKBotFactory have coverage on every method)
    - Look for edge case and try these out (empty texts, special characters, ...)
    - Keep an eye on performance, by running tests a number of times
